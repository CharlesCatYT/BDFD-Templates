# Description
Joins your current voice channel.

Usage :  ` !join `

## Notes
- Helpful in cases like you are listening music with having queued tracks and you want to hop into another voice channel with the bot without ending the queue but you don't have ` Move Members ` permission. Then, this can quite be a handy command.
- I haven't made this command 100% slash supportive.
